# json-log-viewer
Json log viewer is an example of displaying json log files in a html table. The front end (created in Angular 8) allows your to post a json file to the back-end (created using spring boot). The back-end parses the file and responds back with the Json string. The front end then dynamically shows the json in a html table.
